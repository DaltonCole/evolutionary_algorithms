	\section{Self-Adaptive EA Strategy Parameter}
	In this experiment, mutation rate was used as the self-adaptive EA strategy parameter. If the average or best fitness for the current population decreased compared to the previous population, then the mutation rate doubles, with 1 being the max possible value. If the average or best fitness increases or stays the same, then the mutation rate goes back to its original value from the configuration file. The purpose of the change in mutation rate is to increase exploration. 

	\section{Self-Adaptive Performance}
	As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:saMutation1}, Figure \ref{fig:saMutation2}, and Figure \ref{fig:saMutation2}, although having self-adaptive mutation rate, increases the mean fitness value, there is no statistical difference between using the self-adaptive mutation rate strategy employed vs not using it. This is likely due to the fact that mutation resets anytime a non-decrease in fitness happens. Another appropriate strategy would be to involve the current evaluation number in the equation, such that the higher the evaluation number, the lower the mutation rate. This would increase exploration in the beginning, but decrease it as the EA narrows down on a solution.

	Figures \ref{fig:mutFalse} and \ref{fig:mutTrue} show graphs for using self-adaptive mutation rate and not. Figures \ref{fig:mutFalsePicture} and \ref{fig:mutTruePicture} show the corresponding pictures.
